Your third task involves a strategically modifying and forecasting the best energy generation mix. Watch the video above to find our more.

This task has three parts: A, B & C.

Part A 
Familiarising yourself with two documents: the macro enabled Generation Mix Spreadsheet for calculating the generation mix and a Tips sheet. 
i) First, open this up (enable macros) and read through Sheet 1.
ii) Also open Tips for Sheet 1, and use this to assist your understanding of the elements of Sheet 1.

There is no submission for Part A, it is a familiarisation task only.

Part B
Use the Generation Mix Spreadsheet to complete your task on Sheet 2. Once completed, you will upload a screenshot of this (in the next section).
Remember to read the hints that Rimu and his team have provided you within the relevant sheet (on the right).

Task:
In Sheet 2, it is now 2030. 
You need to plan an energy mix to accomplish:
i) a 50% renewable energy target
ii) maintain 100% reliability
iii) keep costs minimal

When you've found a generation mix you're happy with that meets all criteria, take a screenshot to upload in the next section.

Extension: Adjust the storage option to see how this effects your output and costs. 

Remember: Take a screenshot of your completed task!

Part C
Go to Sheet 3 and hit "Run". Here you are testing your generation mix from Sheet 2, and how it stacks up against five consecutive days in January in 2030. The results might not quite be what you expect. 

Is your generation mix reliable over five days?
Adjust your generation mix in Sheet 2 if needed to meet the average 50% renewable criteria and 100% reliability.
Take a screenshot of your result for Sheet 3 ready for submission in the next section.
