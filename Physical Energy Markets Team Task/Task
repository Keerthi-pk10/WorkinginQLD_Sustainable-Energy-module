The Scenario

Renewable energy generation technologies have a variable output. Wind varies with wind speed; solar varies with solar radiance. As such, renewable energies at the current time are best suited to being part of a wider portfolio of assets that can smooth out variability. This is referred to as 'firming'.

We need to ensure that there is 24 hour availability of energy for dispatch to the National Electricity Market (NEM) to meet the required market demands at any time. We aim to increase the share of clean energy to the NEM contributing to efficient wholesale electricity prices. This requires decision making between:

the price at which to bid our energy generated by our assets
when these bids are best optimised to meet energy requirements 

There are numerous factors an energy trader takes into account when determining the profile to offer our units into the market.

Your task: 

Using the spreadsheet template provided: 
Explore the range of power generation profiles by changing the values for Hydro 1 and Hydro 2.
Allocate and identify the available energy to maximise revenue while managing the risk of unexpected high prices. 
Upload a screenshot or your amended Excel file of your chosen power generation profile (in the next section).
Notes:
Should high prices occur you would need to cover your generator commitment level through the day.
Hydro 1 and Hydro 2 cannot output above maximum available energy (MWh) output for the day.
